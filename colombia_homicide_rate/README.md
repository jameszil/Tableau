### Background/Context:
In 2022, I was planning a trip to Colombia. As several people warned me not to go and that it is a dangerous country, I wanted to see if certain areas would be safer than others to visit. As I searched the internet I found there were not many maps specific to Colombia that displayed crime data.
I had little evidence and almost no way of showing people that I am not going to the more dangerous regions that are often negatively publicized in the media. How could I show I'm not naive about the risks of traveling abroad, while also showing that I am consciously traveling to safer regions? This led me to do my own research to get a feel for the layout of the country and validate my assumptions before visiting.

### Objective:
Gather data and create a map of Colombia's crime rate by city and department with available data. Conduct research to see if my maps make sense according to the general sentiment of cities.

<h2>Output:</h2>

Colombia Homicide Rate by City, Department, and % change over 5 years (2010-2015, 2016, 2019)

Some of these outputs will be in Spanish as I got the data from Spanish speaking sources and thought it'd be relevant to cater to a Spanish speaking audience for these visuals.
<br />
<br />
The first map I made is with the most recent data I was able to find for the entire country. It maps the violent crime (measured by homicide rate) for each department.
From this visualization we can see that the southern pacific regions and borders are the most dangerous areas. From the start of this analysis I began to feel secure as I was not planning to visit any of those regions.

<br />
Next, I mapped the homicide rate by city in 2015. As we can see in this map, the southern department Valle del Cauca is particularly dangerous.

These cities with high crime probably spike the overall crime rate for the country, but we can see several dark green dots, indicating there are many larger cities in Colombia with relatively low crime rates.

<br />
The datasets vary significantly in this study, and we can see a very different output in 2016. This made me question my initial conclusions based on the first two maps. If crime rates can change so much from one year to the next, this shows crime could increase rapidly at any moment across the country.

<br />
To counter this change, I calculated the percent change in crime over a 5 year period. This trend would show me if a city's crime is increasing or decreasing over a longer period of time.
While the regular homicide rate is a good indicator of overall crime, the percent change calulcation will help to determine the stability of cities and regions.

<br />
Here we see crime is increasing year over year in the middle Andean region of Colombia.
<br />
Finally, I wanted to see the list of cities and the scale to show the extent each city is improving.

<br />
This was great to see Medellin and suburbs of Medellin like Envigado and Itagüí having the largest decrease in crime. From this data I was able to confidentally tell people leading up to my trip the region I'm traveling to is improving over time.
<br />

Lastly, I made a visualization that shows crime in city boundaries instead of represented as dots in GeoDa, a spatial data analysis software.
