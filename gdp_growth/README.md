### Background/Context:
I've seen many maps online showing Gross Domestic Product by country or even that year's Gross Domestic Product growth as a percentage.
What I struggled to find was a visualization that showed the average change in GDP growth rate as a percentage over a 5 to 10 year period for every country.

### Objective:
Gather data and create a map of the average growth rate of GDP by country.

<h2>Output:</h2>
After gathering and cleaning data, I created a calculation in Tableau that averages the GDP growth rate for each country over the past 8 years.
This will be a good indicator of how economies are performing.

<br />
<br />
As expected, most countries are showing a positive rate, meaning economic outputs are growing year over year.
A few countries show red. This makes sense as Venezuela and Argentina are both having severe economic challenges in recent years. Countries that are engaged in an armed conflict like Yemen may also have decreasing economies.
We see all this backed by the data and represented in the visualization.
<br />
<br />
Then I created labels that indicate the percent growth rate for each country and slightly adjusted the color scaling.
  
We can see by the color shading and the numbers that many countries in Asia and Africa are seeing rapid growth, whereas European countries are typically showing less extreme GDP growth rates.
Libya stands out as showing incredible progress in recent years.
If growth continues, larger countries like China and India stand out as candidates to surpass the United States and Germany to become the world's biggest economies.

<br />
Most of the Western Hemisphere is seeing slow yet steady growth aside from a few outliers like Guyana with extreme growth and Venezuela with extreme decline.
