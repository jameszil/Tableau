### Background/Context:
I grew up in what is considered to be a dangerous city. To my surprise once I started to look at the data, I saw it appeared in many international lists of the most dangerous cities in the entire world. I wanted to somehow visualize that given there was data to do so.

### Objective:
Create and interactive dashboard of the top 50 most dangerous cities in the world using this report from the Department of Justice and Peace of Mexico.

<h2>Output:</h2>

For this dashboard I wanted to keep it simple and effective. I created three separate sheets, the first being a scrollable bar chart showing the rank, city, country, and scale of homicide rate.
Then I created a main map with all the countries in the western hemisphere.
Lastly, as South Africa is the only country in the Eastern Hemisphere with cities in the top 50 list, I decided to create a floating map that fills some of the white space where the Atlantic Ocean is on the first map.
This was an effective design, as it conveys all the data in a simple manner, especially since the South Africa map has the country label in it. I locked the map views as there aren't any dots outside of this main view.
The map is still interactive, meaning users can hover over any dot to see the city information on the maps.

I'm very happy with this output as I had no sort of moodboard or plan when creating it.

I also opted to create outputs in Spanish as I got the data from Spanish sources and thought it'd be relevant to also cater to a Spanish speaking audience for these visuals.
